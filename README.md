# JS Coursework Examples

Collection of projects completed throughout a certification based [HTML, CSS & JS foundations course](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-certified-web-developer/), [(certificates can be found here)](https://www.credential.net/profile/averybrauer780872/wallet) and then an [advanced full-stack JS course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/):

Projects are numbered in order of complexity, the details of which can be found here:

## 1: Yelp Camp

Final project for Node.js section of advanced course. NOTE: This was a code-along project! Unlike the projects in the introductory course which were homework assignments to be turned in and evaluated, the advanced course consisted of predominantly code along exercises, and thus provide more of a record of covered concepts rather than made-from-scratch assignments. This project is provided in its entirety rather than including all of the individual unit projects to learn the concepts implemented here in the final assignment.

## 2 & 3: Event Planner & Todo List Builder

Final projects for JS intro course. Introduction to usage of databases using IndexedDB for client-side storage. Event planner also practiced API integration and usage/storage of geocoding data. The most important aspect of these projects as the final exam of the course is that no assistance or introduction to these tools were provided in the assignment, and they had not been previously covered in the course. The project simply required integration of the leaflet API and either IndexedDB or LocalStorage. The usage and methods of database storage & retrieval were completely new concepts, and the final test was for students to research and learn their implementation on their own. PDF files for project requirements can be found in each of the project folders.

## 4: Film Search Engine

Intermediate API practice returning user search queries from OpenMovies database. Assignment required usage of basic error handling, async functions, and adding UI filters to search results. PDF of homework requirements included.

## 5: Weather App

Introduction to API usage in intro JS course. Similar to in the final projects, the general concept of fetch was introduced in lectures, but the homework was intended to require independent research and experience reading API docs and MDN/StackOverflow to complete. PDF of homework requirements included.
