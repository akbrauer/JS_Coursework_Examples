    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
        <li>Boil the pasta:<br/><em>
        (Put a large pot of salted water on to boil, adding 1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water).</em></li>
        <li>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 9 to 11 minutes, until mostly cooked through but still a bit firm to the bite.</li>
        <li>Using a colander, drain and set to the side.</li>
        <li>Cook the ground beef:<br/><em>
        (As the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the ground beef.)</em></li>
        <li>Season with oregano, sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and aromatics:<br/><em>
        (Add the butter, onions, garlic, and tomato puree to the skillet with the ground beef. Stir until all ingredients are combined.)</em></li>
        <li>Combine the pasta and ground beef:<br/><em>
        (Add the cooked pasta to the beef mixture and stir to combine. Add the heavy whipping cream, chicken stock, parsley, basil, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and 1 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese. Stir until combined.)</em></li>
        <li>Add to a casserole dish:<br/><em>
        (Transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish (no need to grease) and top with the remaining cheese.)</em></li>
        <li>Bake:<br/><em>
        Bake the casserole for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is browned and bubbly.)</em></li>
        <li>Serve and store:<br/><em>
        (For a looser casserole, serve right away. For a casserole that holds its shape a bit, let sit 10 minutes before serving.)</em></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The casserole will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for 3-4 days.<br/><br/>
    You can also freeze it by storing it in an airtight container for up to 3 months. To reheat, microwave or place in the oven at 350°F oven until it is heated through (this will depend on the portion size you are reheating).
